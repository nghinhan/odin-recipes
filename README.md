<!-- This is a Recipes project from Odin project learning environmen -->
To recap what I've learned from the HTML introduction so far - I've learned how to build out an HTML Boilerplate (which can be used the "!" in VScode to quickly generate). I know how to work with text and lists in HTML. Successfully linking "a href" links and images to pages. I've also learn good habits when writing Commit Messages for git purposes. 

I will recap all of these learned skills with this Recipes project.

Enjoy.
